### **Note on Flag Downloader**
The **FlagDownloader** application was developed separately to automate the downloading of flag images. It is **not part of this main application** but was used to collect flag images efficiently from `worldometers.info`. The downloaded images were then stored in the `resources/images/` folder for use in the quiz.

This README provides essential instructions to run and modify the **Flag Quiz Application**. ðŸš€
